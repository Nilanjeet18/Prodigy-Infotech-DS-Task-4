# Prodigy InfoTech Data Science Internship Task 4:

Welcome to my submission for Task 4 of the Data Science Internship at `Prodigy Infotech`. In this task, Analyze and visualize sentiment patterns in social media data to understand public opinion and attitudes towards specific topics or brands.


## Tools and Libraries used
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlip & Seaborn for visualization
- textblob


## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

During the EDA process, I performed the following steps:

1. **Data Cleaning**: Checked for missing values, duplicates, and outliers in the dataset and handled them accordingly.

2. **Visualization**: Created a bar chart, stacked chart to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable.

3. **TextBlob**:extBlob is used in EDA for natural language processing tasks, such as sentiment analysis, text classification, or extracting insights from textual data, by leveraging its simplicity for operations like tokenization, noun phrase extraction, and polarity scoring.



## Conclusion

In conclusion,Analyze and visualize sentiment patterns in social media data to understand public opinion and attitudes towards specific topics or brands.
